        <h1>HTML5</h1>
<p>
    HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
    It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
    The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application
    Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>
    
    <p>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
        status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
        new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
        such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
        HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML</p>

        <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations;
             it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application
              programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate
               for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.</p>

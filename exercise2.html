        <h1>HTML5</h1>
<p>
    HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
    It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
    The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application
    Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>

    <p>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
        status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
        new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
        such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
        HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML
        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations;
             it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application
              programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate
               for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

               <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time,
                HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[9] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments
                on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[10]
                The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                 workshop in June 2004,[11] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,[12] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.[13] Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.[14] The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5.[15] The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.
                WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of the 
                specification on 22 January 2008.[2]</p>
